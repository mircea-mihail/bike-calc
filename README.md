# bike-calc
This project tracks and displays metrics about my biking. The inspiration for this project came from wanting to see my speed on my bike on any given moment. I also wanted to be able to see stats about my biking after a city run, without having to give away my privacy to some random company.

You can find a simulation of this project on my wokwi.com accout: https://wokwi.com/projects/356474047039169537.

# Design
The whole project is going to be soldered and stuck inside a Ferrero Rocher transparrent candy box with some potentiometers and buttons sticking out to navigate the menu. The display consists of an LCD 2X16 display. Below is a hand drawn wiring diagram for this project:

# Progress
So far I only managed to get the menu right, but as soon as spring comes I'm going to define the math behind the project, add a sensor and a data storage module to finish the project. I also need to solder all of the components together as they're currently mounted on a breadboard. As a final step, I'm going to add a schematic for my project and some pictures/
